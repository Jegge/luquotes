The Gateless Gate is a concept that points to an event or non-event that radically changes the relation to reality.
The gate is not a personality shift. It is a perception shift.
If you can find a park, sit there for a bit, and watch how everything moves and wiggles, how the wind blows, how the clouds move. If you can’t find a park, a view through a window is fine too. People and animals move. Everything is one movement, including your body, breath, and thoughts. Watch the totality, and notice there is no “noticer” separate from the noticing.
The “I” is truly only a thought. It is an illusion. A superb illusion. This “I” can be searched for but never found in the real world. This truth has been there all the time, right out in the open. When seeing happens, clarity begins.
Usually getting stuck in the gate is a result of over-intellectualizing instead of directly experiencing life. Check if you can shut off the constant commentary of mind while you walk and experience the light, the air, and what you see.
You can ask yourself, “Now that I know that control was a myth, now that I know that any sense of control was illusion, now that I know that I didn’t really have control, if I stop the pretense and remove all of the effort and emotion and the whole control story if all of that goes, what is left?
There is no need to try and stop the mind from waiting for a pop. Just watch it with a playful curiosity. Allow your expectations to play themselves out and dissolve.
Is it true that there is no separate entity, no “me,” in real life?
Do you think you are through the gate? There is no “me” to go through the gate!
